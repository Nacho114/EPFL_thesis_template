\chapter{Conclusion}

Good job

\section{TODO}

Talk about SNR, role with shannon, and how it affects prediction in a reverse way here! Cite shanon!

Note on how SNR makes also the Kmeans based algo hard; i.e. the noise that is different is 
in the edges and becomes negligble.

Note on how the X indep N -> Xtilde indep N tilde only true for gaussian; for others, there 
will be dependence which the algo we propose can exploit (new one)


Briefly discuss AIC / model selection
intution about using poly reg since it's local

Note that problem is similar to change detection
but it should be easier? -> we don't need to known
when it changes

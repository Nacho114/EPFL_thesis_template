\section{Proof of consistency: A tale of two bounds}

The setup was the linear \textbf{ANM}:

\[ \begin{cases} 
    & Y = aX + E_Y  \\
    & X \bigCI E_Y,\; X \thicksim p_x,\; E_Y \thicksim p_{E_Y}  
 \end{cases}
\]

From $n$ samples $(X_i, Y_i)$ we estimate $\hat{f}_Y$ by regressing $X$ on $Y$ and 
$\hat{f}_X$ for the reverse model. We then comput the residuals

\begin{align}
    &  \hat{e}_Y = Y - \hat{f}_Y(X)\\
    &  \hat{e}_X = X - \hat{f}_X(Y)
\end{align}

We note that for the ease of analysis, it would first be wise to use some fraction 
of the data to first estimate the regression, and then use the remanining for the test.

For $n$ large enough we have that 

$$
    \hat{e}_Y \approx E_Y \thicksim P_{E_Y}
$$

The idea is then to first discretise\footnote{We do so in a naive manner we split
it uniformly into $m$ bins.} $P_{E_Y}$ into $m$ bins, call this discrete distribution
$Q$. We apply the same discretization to obtain $B = (b_1, ..., b_m)$ from $\hat{e}_Y$
and $\tilde{B} = (\tilde{b}_1, ..., \tilde{b}_m)$ from $\hat{e}_X$.

We then decide the causal direction as follows

\[ \begin{cases} 
    & X \rightarrow Y \quad \text{if} \quad C \leq W  \\
    & Y \rightarrow X \quad \text{if} \quad C > W  
 \end{cases}
\]

Where 

$$
    C = \norm{B - U}_{L_1} 
$$
$$
    W = \norm{\tilde{B} - U}_{L_1}
$$


s.t. $U = (\frac{1}{m}, ..., \frac{1}{m})$.

Given our assumption about the \textbf{ANM}, the probability to outpout the correct causal direction is:

$$
   P_{\text{correct}} = \mathbb{P}\left[C \leq W\right] 
$$

We next upper bound thise quantity in order to show consistency

\begin{align}
    \mathbb{P}\left[C \leq W\right] &\geq \mathbb{P}\left[ \underset{\tau \in \mathbb{Q}}{\bigcup} C \leq \tau \cap W > \tau \right] \\
    &\geq \mathbb{P}\left[C \leq \tau \cap W > \tau \right] \\
    &\geq \mathbb{P}\left[C \leq \tau \right] - \mathbb{P}\left[W \leq \tau \right]
\end{align}

The first inequality is due to the fact that we are only taking the union in the rationals\footnote{We note that
we can only take unions over countable sets; recall also that the rationals are dense in the irrationals, so the
inequality is very close to equality (and in practice and among friends it would be).}. The second inequality is done by 
looking at the probability of a fixed $\tau$; and the final one follows by:

$$
    1 \geq \mathbb{P}\left[ C \leq \tau \cup W > \tau \right] = 
    \mathbb{P}\left[ C \leq \tau \right] + \mathbb{P}\left[ W > \tau \right] - \mathbb{P}\left[ C \leq \tau \cap W > \tau \right]
$$

We will next find appropriate bounds for $\mathbb{P}\left[ C \leq \tau \right]$ and $\mathbb{P}\left[W \leq \tau \right]$.

\subsection{Bounding the false false postive}

We will first lower bound $\mathbb{P}\left[ C \leq \tau \right]$ by upper bounding the complement event.

\begin{align}
    \mathbb{P}\left[ C \geq \tau \right] &= \mathbb{P}\left[ \sum_{i = 1}^{m} \abs{b_i - \frac{1}{m}} \geq \tau \right]  \\
    &\leq \mathbb{P}\left[ m \operatorname{max}_{i} \abs{b_i - \frac{1}{m}} \geq \tau \right]  \\
    &= \mathbb{P}\left[ \bigcup_{i} \; \abs{b_i - \frac{1}{m}} \geq \frac{\tau}{m} \right]  \\
    &\leq m \; \mathbb{P}\left[ \abs{b_0 - \frac{1}{m}} \geq \frac{\tau}{m} \right] \\
    &\leq m2\exp \left( -2n \frac{\tau^2}{m^2} \right)
\end{align}

The second to last inequality follows by the union bound and by noting that all $b_i$s are the same since they
are discretized empirical distribution coming from a uniform source. For the final inequality we use Hoeffding's
inequality.

\subsection{Bounding the false negatives}

Recall that what is left to bound is the following quanity, $\mathbb{P}\left[W \leq \tau \right]$; 
for this we first define the following set of probability distributions:

$$
    \Gamma_\tau = \{ \pi \in  \Delta_m : \norm{\pi - U}_{L_1} \leq \tau \}
$$

Where the $\Delta_m$ is the $m$ dimensional simple and $U$ the uniform vector as before.

Observe that: 

$$
    \{ W \leq \tau \} = \{ \tilde{B} \in \Gamma_\tau \}
$$

In essence, we are asking: "what is the chance that the realisation of $\tilde{B}$ – which is the 
empricial distribution of some distribution $Q$ – lies inside some set of distribtions $\Gamma_\tau$.

We note that bounding this kind of event is exactly what Sanov's theorem\footnote{See the section on Information Theory and statistics in 
\cite{cover1999elements}} gives us, an important
result from large deviation theory that also exploits concentration of measure.



Let $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, ..., x_n)$ be a sequence of $n$ each drawn independently from 
a finite universe $U$ with $|U| = m$. Denote by $P_\mathbf{x}$ the empirical distribution – 
or type – for a given sequence $\mathbf{x}$. Let $Q^{n}$ be the product distribution $n$
independent samples of $Q$. 

\begin{theorem}[Sanov’s theorem]\label{sanov}

    Let $\Pi$ be a set of distributions on $U,$ and $m=|U| .$ Let

    \[
        P^{*}=\operatorname{argmin}_{P \in \Pi} D(P \| Q)
    \]
    
    Then
    \[
        \underset{Q^{n}}{\mathbb{P}}\left[P_{\mathbf{x}} \in \Pi\right] \leq(n+1)^{m} 2^{-nD\left(P^{*} \| Q\right)}
    \]
    
\end{theorem}

Applying the above theorem, and noting that $\Gamma_\tau$ takes the place of $\Pi$, $\tilde{B}$ that of $P_{\mathbf{x}}$
and the discretized distribution $\hat{e}_X = X - \hat{f}_X(Y)$ that of $Q$ we get:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{P}\left[W \leq \tau \right] = \mathbb{P}\left[ \tilde{B} \in \Gamma_\tau \right] 
    \leq (n+1)^{m} 2^{-nD\left( \tau \right)}
\end{equation}

Where $D\left( \tau \right) := D\left(P^{*} \| Q\right)$, we make the $\tau$ relation excplicit to 
keep in mind that the minimisation is contrainred to the set $\Gamma_\tau$ which depends on $\tau$.

We remark that the only place of concern is if $D\left(P^{*} \| Q\right) = 0$; assuming however that $Q \neq U$, then 
there will be some $\tau$ s.t. $Q \notin \Gamma_\tau$ and thus $D\left(P^{*} \| Q\right) \neq 0$.

We can now conclude by putting everything together; recall that we had shown that we could bound the success probability 
as follows:



\begin{align}
    \mathbb{P}\left[C \leq W\right] &\geq \mathbb{P}\left[C \leq \tau \right] - \mathbb{P}\left[W \leq \tau \right] \\
    &\geq 1 - 2m\exp \left( -2n \frac{\tau^2}{m^2} \right) - (n+1)^{m} 2^{-nD\left( \tau \right)}
\end{align}

This, if we fix $m$, and if there exists some $\tau$ s.t. $D\left( \tau \right) > 0$ then we get consistency
by letting $n \rightarrow \infty$.

We note that to get the best bound we may maximisise the r.h.s. w.r.t. $\tau$.

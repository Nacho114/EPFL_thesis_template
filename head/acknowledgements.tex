I would first like to thank my family for having supported me for so long:
I would like to thank my mother for having always been there and believed in me, 
my father for financially supporting me for so long and having faith in my endeavors, 
and my sister for trying to remind me of what's important.


As with countless other souls, I had to make some last minute decisions 
due to Covid-19; I am very grateful to both Martin and Praneeth for 
accepting to take me on board for my thesis on such a short notice. 
I owe a special thanks to Yunus Inan; I was very lucky to have as a 
flatmate such a talented information theorist --- some ideas and a lot 
of the proofs came as a result of our interactions.

I would finally like to thank Darkhan Musanov, who's strong conviction in me 
had an important role in my decision to leave business school and to try something 
a bit harder.
